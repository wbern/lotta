## General Guidelines

### Output Style

- **Never explicitly mention TDD** in code, comments, commits, PRs, or issues
- Write natural, descriptive code without meta-commentary about the development process
- The code should speak for itself - TDD is the process, not the product

Analyze the current conversation context and identify things that have not yet been addressed. Look for:

1. **Incomplete implementations** - Code that was started but not finished
2. **Unused variables/results** - Values that were captured but never used
3. **Missing tests** - Functionality without test coverage

4. **User requests** - Things the user asked for that weren't fully completed
5. **TODO comments** - Any TODOs mentioned in conversation
6. **Error handling gaps** - Missing error cases or edge cases
7. **Documentation gaps** - Undocumented APIs or features
8. **Consistency check** - Look for inconsistent patterns, naming conventions, or structure across the codebase

Present findings as a prioritized list with:

- What the gap is
- Why it matters
- Suggested next action

If there are no gaps, confirm that everything discussed has been addressed.

**User arguments:**

Gap: $ARGUMENTS

**End of user arguments**
