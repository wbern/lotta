# Worktree Cleanup

## General Guidelines

### Output Style

- **Never explicitly mention TDD** in code, comments, commits, PRs, or issues
- Write natural, descriptive code without meta-commentary about the development process
- The code should speak for itself - TDD is the process, not the product

Clean up merged worktrees by finding the oldest merged branch, consolidating settings, and removing stale worktrees.

  <step_1>
    <description>Determine default branch and verify we're on it</description>
    <find_default_branch>
      <command>git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD | sed 's@^refs/remotes/origin/@@'</command>
      <fallback>git remote show origin | grep 'HEAD branch' | cut -d: -f2 | tr -d ' '</fallback>

    <exclude_default>Filter out the default branch worktree from cleanup candidates</exclude_default>
    <purpose>Identify all worktrees that could potentially be cleaned up</purpose>
  </step_2>

  <step_3>
    <description>Find oldest worktree by directory age</description>
    <get_worktree_ages>
      <detect_platform>uname -s (returns "Darwin" for macOS, "Linux" for Linux)</detect_platform>
      <command_macos>git worktree list | grep -v "\[$DEFAULT_BRANCH\]" | awk '{print $1}' > /tmp/worktrees-$$.txt && while IFS= read -r path; do echo "$(/usr/bin/stat -f '%Sm' -t '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M' "$path" 2>/dev/null)|$path"; done < /tmp/worktrees-$$.txt | sort; rm -f /tmp/worktrees-$$.txt</command_macos>

      <purpose>List all worktrees sorted by directory modification time (oldest first)</purpose>
      <critical_notes>
        - Replace $DEFAULT_BRANCH with value from step_1 (e.g., "main" or "master")
        - grep "\[branch\]" matches branch name in brackets, not paths containing the word
        - Temp file approach avoids subshell parsing issues with piped while-loops
        - /usr/bin/stat on macOS avoids homebrew stat conflicts

<important_notes>

- Uses PR/MR merge status as the ONLY reliable way to verify if a branch was merged
- DOES NOT use "git branch --merged" command as it's unreliable for merge verification
- Only processes branches with PRs/MRs that were definitively merged to default branch
- Skips worktrees without merged PRs/MRs and continues to next oldest candidate
- Checks and optionally closes related issues
- Prioritizes oldest worktrees by directory age first for systematic cleanup
- Warns about very recent worktrees (created within 24 hours) to avoid cleaning active work
- Preserves useful development settings before deletion
- Requires explicit confirmation before any destructive actions
- Handles locked worktrees automatically
- Processes one worktree at a time to maintain control
- Must be run from default branch for safety

Limitations:

- Assumes remote is named "origin" (most common convention)
- Supports macOS and Linux only (no Windows support)
- Requires MCP server or CLI for git hosting provider (GitHub, GitLab, etc.)
