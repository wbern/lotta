description: Create multiple atomic git commits, one logical change at a time
argument-hint: [optional-commit-description]

## General Guidelines

### Output Style

- **Never explicitly mention TDD** in code, comments, commits, PRs, or issues
- Write natural, descriptive code without meta-commentary about the development process
- The code should speak for itself - TDD is the process, not the product

Create multiple atomic git commits, committing the smallest possible logical unit at a time

**User arguments:**

Busycommit: $ARGUMENTS

**End of user arguments**

## Commit Message Rules

Follows [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) standard.

1. **Format**: `type(#issue): description`
   - Use `#123` for local repo issues
   - Use `owner/repo#123` for cross-repo issues
   - Common types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `refactor`, `test`, `chore`

2. **AI Credits**: **NEVER include AI credits in commit messages**
   - No "Generated with Claude Code"
   - No "Co-Authored-By: Claude" or "Co-Authored-By: Happy"
   - Focus on the actual changes made, not conversation history

3. **Content**: Write clear, concise commit messages describing what changed and why

## Process

1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to review changes
2. Run `git log --oneline -5` to see recent commit style
3. Stage relevant files with `git add`
4. Create commit with descriptive message
5. Verify with `git status`

## Example

```bash
git add <files>
git commit -m "feat(#123): add validation to user input form"
```

## Atomic Commit Approach

Each commit should represent ONE logical change. Do NOT bundle multiple unrelated changes into one commit.

- Identify the smallest atomic units of change
- For EACH atomic unit: stage only those files/hunks, commit, verify
- Use `git add -p` to stage partial file changes when a file contains multiple logical changes
- Repeat until all changes are committed
- It is OK to create multiple commits without stopping - keep going until `git status` shows clean

## Multi-Commit Example

If a single file contains multiple unrelated changes, use `git add -p` to stage hunks interactively:

```bash
# Stage only the validation-related hunks from the file
git add -p src/user-service.ts
# Select 'y' for validation hunks, 'n' for others
git commit -m "feat(#123): add email format validation"

# Stage the error handling hunks
git add -p src/user-service.ts
git commit -m "fix(#124): handle null user gracefully"

# Stage remaining changes
git add src/user-service.ts
git commit -m "refactor: extract user lookup to helper"
```
