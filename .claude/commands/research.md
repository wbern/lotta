description: Research a problem in parallel via web docs, web search, codebase exploration, and deep ultrathink
argument-hint: <research topic or question>

## General Guidelines

### Output Style

- **Never explicitly mention TDD** in code, comments, commits, PRs, or issues
- Write natural, descriptive code without meta-commentary about the development process
- The code should speak for itself - TDD is the process, not the product

**User arguments:**

Research: $ARGUMENTS

**End of user arguments**

Research the following problem or question thoroughly, like a senior developer would.

## Step 1: Launch Parallel Research Agents

Use the Task tool to spawn these subagents **in parallel** (all in a single message):

1. **Web Documentation Agent** (subagent_type: general-purpose)
   - Search official documentation for the topic
   - Find best practices and recommended patterns
   - Locate relevant GitHub issues or discussions

2. **Web Search Agent** (subagent_type: general-purpose)
   - Perform broad web searches for solutions and discussions
   - Find Stack Overflow answers, blog posts, and tutorials
   - Note common pitfalls and gotchas

3. **Codebase Explorer Agent** (subagent_type: Explore)
   - Search the codebase for related patterns
   - Find existing solutions to similar problems
   - Identify relevant files, functions, or components

## Step 2: Library Documentation (Optional)

If the research involves specific frameworks or libraries:

- Use Context7 MCP tools (mcp__context7__resolve-library-id, then get-library-docs)
- Get up-to-date API references and code examples
- If Context7 is unavailable, note this in findings so user knows library docs were harder to obtain

## Step 3: Deep Analysis

With all gathered context, perform extended reasoning (ultrathink) to:

- Analyze the problem from first principles
- Consider edge cases and trade-offs
- Synthesize insights across all sources
- Identify conflicts between sources

## Step 4: Present Findings

Present a structured summary to the user:

### Problem Statement

Describe the problem and why it matters.

### Key Findings

Summarize the most relevant solutions and approaches.

### Codebase Patterns

Document how the current codebase handles similar cases.

### Recommended Approach

Provide your recommendation based on all research.

### Conflicts

Highlight where sources disagree and provide assessment of which is more reliable.

### Sources

List all source links with brief descriptions. This section is required.

## Research Guidelines

- Prioritize official documentation over blog posts
- Prefer solutions that match existing codebase patterns
- Note major.minor versions for libraries/frameworks (patch versions only if critical)
- Flag conflicting information across sources
- Write concise, actionable content
- Use active voice throughout
- **Do not create output files** - present findings directly in conversation unless user explicitly requests a file
