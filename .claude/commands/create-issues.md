# Create Issues: PRD-Informed Task Planning for TDD

Create structured implementation plan that bridges product thinking (PRD) with test-driven development.

## General Guidelines

### Output Style

- **Never explicitly mention TDD** in code, comments, commits, PRs, or issues
- Write natural, descriptive code without meta-commentary about the development process
- The code should speak for itself - TDD is the process, not the product

**User arguments:**

Create-issues: $ARGUMENTS

**End of user arguments**

(If no input provided, check conversation context)

## Input Processing

The input can be one of:

1. **GitHub Issue URL** (e.g., `https://github.com/owner/repo/issues/123`)
2. **GitHub Issue Number** (e.g., `#123` or `123`)
3. **Feature Description** (e.g., "Add user authentication")
4. **Empty** - use conversation context

### GitHub Issue Integration

If input looks like a GitHub issue:

**Step 1: Extract Issue Number**

- From URL: extract owner/repo/number
- From number: try to infer repo from git remote
- From branch name: check patterns like `issue-123`, `123-feature`, `feature/123`

**Step 2: Fetch Issue**

Try to fetch the issue using GitHub MCP (mcp__github__issue_read tool).

If GitHub MCP is not configured, show:

```
GitHub MCP not configured!
See: https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers/tree/main/src/github
Trying GitHub CLI fallback...
```

Then try using `gh issue view [ISSUE_NUMBER] --json` as fallback.

**Step 3: Use Issue as Discovery Input**

- Title → Feature name
- Description → Problem statement and context
- Labels → Type/priority hints
- Comments → Additional requirements and discussion
- Linked issues → Dependencies

Extract from GitHub issue:

- Problem statement and context
- Acceptance criteria (if present)
- Technical notes (if present)
- Related issues/dependencies

## Process

## Discovery Phase

Understand the requirement by asking (use AskUserQuestion if needed):

**Problem Statement**

- What problem does this solve?
- Who experiences this problem?
- What's the current pain point?

**Desired Outcome**

- What should happen after this is built?
- How will users interact with it?
- What does success look like?

**Scope & Constraints**

- What's in scope vs. out of scope?
- Any technical constraints?
- Dependencies on other systems/features?

**Context Check**

- Search codebase for related features/modules
- Check for existing test files that might be relevant

## Key Principles

**From PRD World:**

- Start with user problems, not solutions
- Define success criteria upfront
- Understand constraints and scope

**From TDD World:**

- Make acceptance criteria test-ready
- Break work into small, testable pieces
- Each task should map to test(s)

## Integration with Other Commands

- **Before /create-issues**: Use `/spike` if you need technical exploration first
- **After /create-issues**: Use `/red` to start TDD on first task
