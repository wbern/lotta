## General Guidelines

### Output Style

- **Never explicitly mention TDD** in code, comments, commits, PRs, or issues
- Write natural, descriptive code without meta-commentary about the development process
- The code should speak for itself - TDD is the process, not the product

**User arguments:**

Simplify: $ARGUMENTS

**End of user arguments**

(If there was no info above, fallback to the context of the conversation)

Reduce complexity while keeping tests green.

## Core Principles

**YAGNI** - Don't build until actually needed. Delete "just in case" code.

**KISS** - Simplest solution that works. Clever is the enemy of clear.

**Rule of Three** - Don't abstract until 3rd occurrence. "Prefer duplication over wrong abstraction" (Sandi Metz).

## When NOT to Simplify

- Essential domain complexity (regulations, business rules)
- Performance-critical optimized code
- Concurrency/thread-safety requirements
- Security-sensitive explicit checks

## Prerequisites

Tests must be green. If failing, use `/green` first.

## Code Complexity Signals

Look for these refactoring opportunities:

- [ ] Nesting > 3 levels deep
- [ ] Functions > 20 lines
- [ ] Duplicate code blocks
- [ ] Abstractions with single implementation
- [ ] "Just in case" parameters or config
- [ ] Magic values without names
- [ ] Dead/unused code

## Techniques

| Pattern | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Guard clause | Nested `if/else` | Early `return` |
| Named condition | Complex boolean | `const isValid = ...` |
| Extract constant | `if (x > 3)` | `if (x > MAX_RETRIES)` |
| Flatten callback | `.then().then()` | `async/await` |

**Also apply:** Consolidate duplicates, inline unnecessary abstractions, delete dead code.

## Validate

1. Tests still green
2. Code reads more clearly
3. No behavioral changes

**Simplify** removes complexity locally. **Refactor** improves architecture broadly. Use `/refactor` if changes require structural reorganization.

### Watch for Brittle Tests

When refactoring implementation, watch for **Peeping Tom** tests that:

- Test private methods or internal state directly
- Assert on implementation details rather than behavior
- Break on any refactoring even when behavior is preserved

If tests fail after a pure refactoring (no behavior change), consider whether the tests are testing implementation rather than behavior.
